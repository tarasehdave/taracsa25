    "## Overview\n",
    "The Yucatán Peninsula, located in southeastern Mexico, is known for its rich history, Mayan ruins, stunning beaches, and vibrant culture. The region offers a unique blend of ancient traditions and modern attractions, with highlights ranging from the world-famous Chichen Itza to the beautiful beaches of the Riviera Maya. Visitors can explore cenotes, relax in colonial towns like Mérida, or dive into the vibrant marine life of the Caribbean Sea. Yucatán’s combination of history, nature, and culture makes it a top travel destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Top Attractions\n",
    "1. **Chichen Itza** – One of the New Seven Wonders of the World, Chichen Itza is an ancient Mayan city that features the iconic pyramid of El Castillo (Temple of Kukulkan). The site is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and offers a fascinating glimpse into Mayan culture and architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Cenotes** – Yucatán is famous for its cenotes, natural sinkholes filled with crystal-clear water. Popular cenotes include Cenote Ik Kil, Cenote Suytun, and Cenote Dos Ojos. These natural wonders offer opportunities for swimming, diving, and exploring underground caves.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Tulum** – A picturesque coastal town that features stunning beaches and the ancient Mayan ruins of Tulum, which sit dramatically on a cliff overlooking the Caribbean Sea. Tulum is known for its laid-back vibe and eco-friendly resorts.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Uxmal** – A lesser-known but equally impressive Mayan archaeological site, Uxmal is famous for its intricate stone carvings and the towering Pyramid of the Magician. It offers a more intimate exploration compared to the larger Chichen Itza.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Mérida** – The capital city of Yucatán, Mérida is a charming colonial city with vibrant architecture, bustling markets, and a rich cultural scene. Visitors can enjoy traditional Yucatecan cuisine and explore the historic Plaza Grande.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Río Lagartos** – A coastal reserve known for its diverse wildlife, including flamingos, crocodiles, and exotic birds. It’s a fantastic spot for nature lovers and those interested in eco-tourism and boat tours through the mangroves.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Best Time to Visit\n",
    "The best time to visit Yucatán is during the dry season, from November to April, when the weather is warm and there’s little rain. Temperatures range from 25°C to 30°C (77°F to 86°F), making it ideal for outdoor activities, beach visits, and exploring archaeological sites. The wet season (May to October) brings higher temperatures and more rainfall, but it can also be a good time for fewer crowds and lower hotel prices. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Local Cuisine\n",
    "Yucatán has a distinct culinary tradition influenced by Mayan, Spanish, and Caribbean flavors. Some must-try dishes include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cochinita Pibil**: A traditional Yucatecan dish made from slow-roasted pork marinated in achiote and sour orange, cooked in banana leaves. It’s often served with tortillas, pickled red onions, and habanero salsa.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sopa de Lima**: A refreshing lime soup made with shredded chicken, fried tortilla strips, and a flavorful broth infused with citrus.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Panuchos**: Fried tortillas stuffed with black beans and topped with shredded turkey or chicken, lettuce, avocado, and pickled onions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Salbutes**: Similar to panuchos, but with an unfilled, puffed-up tortilla topped with chicken, avocado, lettuce, and tomato.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Poc Chuc**: A marinated, grilled pork dish served with tangy tomato salsa and a side of black beans, often enjoyed with tortillas.\n",
